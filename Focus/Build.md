# Build Focus
Previously students have focused on the use case of costing a BIM model, but maybe you are inspired to look at other examples? these could include:
* construction planning
* automated building permits
* building regulation compliance
* 3DCP from any IFC

If you have a build focus the following provides an examples of how you could approach the course.

## Assignment 1
You are probably going to want to find out pretty early what informaiton is available. At this stage you might not be sure what you are going to focus on and will not have to define it until the end of this assignment (but then your group is locked).

## Assignment 2
From the information that you haev found available - what use case could you solve with the model you have?
If you do not have the information perhaps you could model it? could you link with another group that could then analyse to see if your work was complete?
Or perhpas you would like to do teh analysis for another model group?

## Assignment 3
Ontologies: have you found that th

## Assignment 4


## Previous Projects for inspiration
Most of the examples are developed as standalone Python scripts (not in Blender), but these can be adapted - make sure you credit the previous work and are clear about the changes / improvements you have made.
