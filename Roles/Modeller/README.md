# OpenBIM Modeller
Firstly, the transition to OpenBIM modelling tools will affect BIM Modellers by encouraging IFC based modelling directly in the software in tools such as the free and Open Source software (FOSS) BlenderBIM. Furthermore, this supports working in emerging platforms such as Speckle, BHoM (Elshani et al., 2022) and IFC.js as well as the new tools and services that they afford. 
* Level 1: Modelling a building in native (closed) BIM software and exporting to IFC, with a focus on mapping modelled properties.
* Level 2: Modelling and editing a model in BlenderBIM or FreeCAD for instance, including appropriate object meta information in conformance with the OpenBIM IFC standard.
* Level 3: Parametric modelling of the OpenBIM objects using visual programming languages, such as Grasshopper, Dynamo and Sverchok / Geometry nodes in Blender(BIM) for instance.
