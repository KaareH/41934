# OpenBIM Roles
Five OpenBIM roles are presented here, a three-level rubric based on Figure 2. Level 1 (beginner) would be an introductory exercise. Level 2 intermediate and advanced (Level 3) are explored through progressively more advanced projects. Following this a suggestion for future research is made to provide a link between the proposed teaching and the transition to the OpenBIM vision presented earlier.
