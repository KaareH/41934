# OpenBIM Roles

Five OpenBIM roles with their own 3 level rubric are presented in the links below:

* R1: OpenBIM [Modeller](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Roles/Modeller)
* R2: OpenBIM [Analyst](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Roles/Analyst)
* R3: OpenBIM [Manager](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Roles/Manager)
* R4: OpenBIM [Ontologist](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Roles/Ontologist)
* R5: OpenBIM [Champion](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Roles/Champion)

Each role is described against a three-level rubric. 

* Level 1 (beginner) would be an introductory exercise.
* Level 2 intermediate and
* Level 3 (advanced) are explored through progressively more advanced projects.
