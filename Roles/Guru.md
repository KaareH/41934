# OpenBIM Guru
The OpenBIM Guru should have mastered the other roles and specialise in two of them. The role includes an ability to support others to learn how to get the guidance they need through using or developing their own OpenBIM tools for instance (Figure 2). They will be able to provide the essential service in a knowledge-based industry, of being able to teach and mentor peers to develop OpenBIM skills and concepts in one or more of the other roles proposed here, eventually leading to the creation of more OpenBIM Gurus to support the OpenBIM transition, which is the goal of the course.
* Level 1: Write a markdown tutorial and concise video.
* Level 2: Write a Jupyter notebook tutorial.
* Level 3: Develop micro credentials / course activities for specific learning objectives.
