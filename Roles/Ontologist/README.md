# OpenBIM Ontologist
Students interested in this area would focus on (re)organizing OpenBIM data including both classification systems and the Linked Open Building Data (Rasmussen et al., 2020), which typically focusses on semantic linked building data queries about the building, its systems, components, their relationships, and properties. This new role extends traditional Linked Building Data semantic analysis to organize the digital representation of the design systems to support design experimentation at a system rather than component level. 
* Level 1: Analyse a standard IFC file in excel generated using the IFA analyzer tool and classify its objects.
* Level 2: Apply, develop or extend an appropriate classification system for a specific use case.
* Level 3: Focus on Linked Data and Ontologies such as the building topology ontology (BOT) (Rasmussen et al., 2020).
