# OpenBIM Analyst

The OpenBIM analyst role supports the modeller in the analysis and interoperability of their OpenBIM models, FAIR data and processes. New OpenBIM tools could be built by OpenBIM Analysts that would be trained in OpenBIM tool development.  This would support the transition from file based information exchange, to the streaming and reframing of data services such as Speckle and the querying of OpenBIM data using OpenBIM analytical tools via an application programming interface (API). The skills and tools in this area are developing at such a rate that new technologies and tools arrive during a semester. Therefore, students need to be provided the foundational concepts and approaches so that they can use ‘self learning’ techniques to support their own transition to becoming an OpenBIM AEC professional.
* Level 1: Analyse a standard IFC file in Excel generated using the IFA analyzer tool and create a new Excel sheet dashboard queried from the IFC information in Excel.
* Level 2: Analyse the property sets of an IFC file in the BlenderBIM GUI and develop a simple Python Script in BlenderBIM using ifcOpenShell.
* Level 3: Develop standalone Python programmes using ifcOpenShell for specific use cases.
