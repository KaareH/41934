This is activity is linked to the following learning objectives.

LO1: Analyse a current BIM use case in BPMN.
LO2: Propose a tool or workflow for a BIM use case in BPMN
LO3: Design an OpenBIM tool or workflow to address the challenges of a specific use case based on international and national standards and best practice.

Advanced BIM isnâ€™t about changing everything at once. It is about focusing on a specific use case, and starting to think about how you would test a potential solution to that use case before you build the solutions. It is about considering, the information that you need - what can you get from the IFC for instance?

In this way, this assignment focuses provides an opportunity to clearly scope your ambition and motivation for your OpenBIM workflow / tool. Reducing the potential to overstretch and providing an opportunity to demonstrate the potential value that you offer to a company quickly in a controlled space.

We are also really interested in presenting BIM as a method for you to explore the things that interest you. Therefore, in this assignment we want you to identify 2 use cases that you are really passionate about and want to explore further. One of these will end up being the one that you choose in your final project.

Content

In this assignment you will dig deeper into use cases and some tools and standards to support this and develop two BIM use case that extends provide a real example of a BIM use that you can then use to develop your final project (you will choose one of these BIM uses for the final project). We will also introduce the concepts and tools ofÂ IDM.

Assignment Format

Therefore, the core of the assignment is:Â For your selected use case, produce a readme.md in markdown. For more information about markdown, please check out thisÂ awesome markdown tutorial

Assignment should include

Report (documenting sections 1,2,3,5,6,7)

Use_case_report_Team_XX.pdf

Information exchange excel sheet (for section 4)

Use_case_INFX_Team_XX.xlsx

BPMN file of current use case (redrawn by you) + BPMN file for your proposed tool

NAME_OF_USE_CASE_Team_XX.bpmn

NAME_ OF_PROPOSED_PROCESS_Team_XX.bpmn

The report

You should produce a report for each of your chosen usecases this should be written in markdown. The contents of the report are based on a hybrid of full Information delivery manuals, the BIM Execution Plan from Penn State and common development methodologies from computer science. in this sense, teh use case report you will produce for this assignment is special as it includes the plan for the development of a new tool / workflow. It should include the following stages.

#

	

Part

	

Description

	

Resources




1

	

Goal

	

Goal of the tool / workflow in one sentence. i.e. to support the user to calculate the total total cost of the project.

	


2

	

Model Use (Bim Uses)

	

Please refer initially to theÂ Mapping BIM uses, use cases and processesÂ section in this document.

	


3

	

Process

	

1. model the process diagram from your use case in BPMN.io please remember to save the .bpmn file and you can save a .svg file that you can insert into your report. 2. description of theÂ processÂ of your tool / workflow.

	

Link to original process mapsÂ here.




4

	

Information Exchange

	

Fill out the excel template with the information for your planned tool / workflow. For this you will need access to the excel, and the Dikon document to help you specify the LOD (LOR,LOG,LOI) for each element you need for you tool / workflow. This can get confusing - donâ€™t worry we can helpÂ ðŸ˜Š

	

Dikon document describing the LOD etc. used in Denmark. Excel document (find link for this.......)




5

	

Your tool / workflow

	

Description of how your tool / workflow would solve the use case

	

Examples from previous years....




6

	

IFC

	

Describe the IFC entities and properties for each of the elements you identified in your information exchange.

	


7

	

Delivery

	

Description of how you would make the tool / workflow - what steps would you go through?

	




A3: Use Case

Select and Analyse a BIM Use Case. Include the IFC entities and properties you will need for your tool and a BPMN describing the new process.

More info on this activity will be provide in week 2.
