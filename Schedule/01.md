### Activity


### 1) Choose a [focus] area / subject.
* Find a focus area / subject that you are interested in - the point of the focus area is to help your group have a common aim. Each focus area will then go to different part of the room. If you want to be with a friend, go to a place you both want to be :)

### 2) Download the model for your focus area
* ___ Download the [Skylab IFC models](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/le/content/167582/Home) *[enrolled students only]*.
* ___ decide which model you would like to focus on based on your focus area.

### 3) Download Blender / Bonsai (fka installation) and investigate the model
* ___ to install and set up Blender and the Bonsai (fka BlenderBIM) add on.
* [Install](https://blenderbim.org/docs/users/installation.html) Blender and BlenderBIM following the instruction page, with the difference that you should follow the [unstable installation](https://blenderbim.org/docs/devs/installation.html#unstable-installation). Here is also a [video explaination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-937k6fvKk&t=0s) by Ifc Architect (notice that the new version of BlenderBIM looks a bit different).

### 4) View the model in Blender / Bonsai (fka BlenderBIM)
* [BlenderBIM/Bonsai interface guide](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/users/modeling/interface.html)
* [understanding IFC](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/users/modeling/understanding_ifc.html)
* [Starting a new IFC Project](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/users/modeling/starting_new_project.html)
* [Importing and Viewing IFC Models](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/users/modeling/importing_viewing_models.html)

### 5) Next Steps
You are now one step closer in your journey to becoming an OpenBIM guru. Check out the next session [here](https://github.com/timmcginley/41934/tree/main/Schedule/02).
