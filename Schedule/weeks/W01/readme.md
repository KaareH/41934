## Learning from OpenBIM

Welcome to the advanced BIM course. The idea of the course is not to learn HOWTO BIM but to learn from BIM. Therefore there is a reduced emphasis on modelling in this course. In place of modelling we focus on analyising existing BIM models. The idea is that if you learn how to analyse the BIM models to get the information you need you will then know the what to model. This  leads us to our next aim, to model less. What is the minimum information that could be exchanged to guide the person that requires that information.

## Rules for the course

1. Try and use FOSS (Free and Open Source) Solutions first â€“ (as much as possible)
1. No pdfs - replace with .md (this) and .svg for drawings
1. Try and reuse (and make iterative improvements) on existing solutions (circular digital tools)
1. Help each other, if you work out something cool share it, you do not get extra credit for keeping it to yourself, but we really like it when you help each other :)
