## Session 1 OpenBIM

*2nd September 2024*

## Aim

Welcome to the advanced BIM course. This course is different from other BIM courses. The idea  is to learn _from_ BIM not learn _howto_ BIM. Therefore we will NOT be training you to model things in BIM tools.

In place of modelling we focus on analyising existing BIM models. The idea is that if you learn how to analyse the BIM models to get the information you need you will then know the what to model. This leads us to our next aim, to model less. 

>What is the minimum information that could be exchanged to guide the person that requires that information?

## Rules for the course

1. Use FOSS (Free and Open Source) Solutions first â€“ (as much as possible)
1. No pdfs - replace with .md (this) and .svg for drawings
1. Try and reuse (and make iterative improvements) on existing solutions (circular digital tools).
1. Help each other, if you work something out, cool, share it, you do not get extra credit for keeping it to yourself, but we really like it when you help each other :)

## Today's session

Please watch the introduction video which provides an introduction to:
* ___ What is [BIM] and what is the focus of the course?
* ___ What are the Benefits and challenges of [BIM]? (Inc. Silos)
* ___ What is OpenBIM?
* ___ [BIM Maturity Levels] [-]
* ___ [FAIR] Principles [ ]
* ___ [Interoperability] Principles [ ]
* ___ [Standards], Technical Specifications and Guides [ ]
* ___ Course [Assignments](/41934/Assignments) and Feedback [ ]
* ___ What is [(Open)BIM] and what are what are [FOSS] tools and FAIR data?  [ ]
* ___ What is [IFC]?

### In class activity with Introduction.

* ___ IFC [entities] and [properties] in [IFC File Analyzer]

1. Download the [Skylab IFC models](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/le/content/167582/Home) *[enrolled students only]*.


1. Select the file for the discipline you want to work with based on your [focus area].

* [Install](https://blenderbim.org/docs/users/installation.html) Blender and BlenderBIM following the instruction page, with the difference that you should follow the [unstable installation](https://blenderbim.org/docs/devs/installation.html#unstable-installation). Here is also a [video explaination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-937k6fvKk&t=0s) by Ifc Architect (notice that the new version of BlenderBIM looks a bit different).

<!--1. Install [Ifc File Analyzer]
1. Run [Ifc File Analyzer]
1. Open the generated Spreadsheet for the file you have generated.
-->

You are now one step closer in your journey to becoming an OpenBIM guru. Check out the next session [here](https://github.com/timmcginley/41934/tree/main/Schedule/02).
