* ___ IFC [entities] and [properties] in [IFC File Analyzer]

1. Download the [Skylab IFC models](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/le/content/167582/Home) *[enrolled students only]*.


1. Select the file for the discipline you want to work with based on your [focus area].

* [Install](https://blenderbim.org/docs/users/installation.html) Blender and BlenderBIM following the instruction page, with the difference that you should follow the [unstable installation](https://blenderbim.org/docs/devs/installation.html#unstable-installation). Here is also a [video explaination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-937k6fvKk&t=0s) by Ifc Architect (notice that the new version of BlenderBIM looks a bit different).


1. [understanding IFC](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/users/modeling/understanding_ifc.html)
2. [Starting a new IFC Project](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/users/modeling/starting_new_project.html)
3. [Importing and Viewing IFC Models](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/users/modeling/importing_viewing_models.html)
