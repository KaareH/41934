Discuss in your groups the following based on the use case you have.
* Who is the use case for?	
* What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise would you need to use to solve the use case?
* What IFC concepts would be needed in this use case?
* What disciplinary analysis does it require?	
* What building elements are you interested in?
* What are the IFC names for these elements?
