# Examples

## IFC Models
BIM research is curtailed by the lack of standard models we do have some. But it is an area we hope to improve.

## Ifc File Analyser Excel Sheets
The excel sheets generated from the models shows here, just in case you have trouble exporting them.

## IfcOpenShell Scripts
We have put a lot of time into organising the scripts into three levels, basic, intermediate, advanced. the idea would eb to tackle different levels in teh different sessions.
