# A2: FutureBIM
We introduce potential future BIM tools and then in class we investigate their connections and the roles they will play in your future careers. This assignment is linked to the following learning objectives.

L03: Design rules to check conformance of an IFC mode
L05: Evaluate an IFC model and provide appropriate feedback / guidance for a specific use case and user.
L06: Evaluate the suitability of software licensing options for digital tools.

In this activity you will be introduced to a [‘metadisciplinary framework’ for BIM (McGinley Krijnen, 2022)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363579368_A_framework_for_meta-disciplinary_building_analysis/stats). Building on the investigation of BlenderBIM and Speckle in Activity 1, in A2 we will introduce IFC.JS and Linked Data.

As an advanced course in BIM our intention is not to ‘teach’ software but to introduce concepts and tools that you can then develop expertise in and we can help you when you run into challenges.

We have gathered the four most exciting potential future (open)BIM technologies in this course however it is unclear how they fit together and the design and engineering experience that they could provide you in your future careers.

Therefore, the emphasis in this assignment is in your groups to explore focused parts of this future (open) BIM ecosystem, supported by theory, frameworks and examples provided in the course lectures.

More info on this activity will be provide in week 2.
