# A4: Custom Tool

In this assignment we will develop a tool / workflow based on the use case you defined in the [previous assignment](https://github.com/timmcginley/41934/tree/main/A3__UseCase):
The tool must:
* Address your [use case](https://github.com/timmcginley/41934/tree/main/A3__UseCase):
* ideally be written in Python, but can be other approaches in special cases if agreed with the course responsible.
* Be summarised in a 2 minute video.
You will produce one final tool in the following folders, the structure of which is summarised below.
## 1. Input
This includes any data that you are using to 
You may include the code from the previous assignment to load the data from the IFC direct into your current tool. Alternatively you may want to load the data from the excel you have already generated in the previous assignment. In this case you should include the previous excel from assignment A4 in this folder.

Secondly you may also include the assumptions file from the previous assignment here.


## 2. Your tool
The tool should develop one of the use cases you identified in A3 and use the input you gained in A4.

## Submission structure 

This assumes that you are doing a normal python project.

Custom tool

- FOLDER: name of use case
  - FOLDER: model
    - duplex or something else (ifc)
  - FOLDER: input (this is in case you are importing some excel assumption data or regulations for instance)
    - excel data for instance.
  - FOLDER: output
    - this is if the output for your tool is a file, for instance an excel file.
  - main.py
  - FOLDER: documentation / readme.md file - you could use typora to edit.
    - Place the step by step guide to using your tool in here.

Add to the earlier workâ€¦ - produce a sheet of the data and then the dashboardâ€¦
## 1. Python script to produce Excel based on IFC
1. a python script to gather the data that you need for your project. This python script should produce an excel file containing the data from the IFC that you need in your project. for this we want you to:
* be careful about the naming of the sheets as this provides the hierarchy of information that you want to use in your tool.
## 2. Excel including assumptions and external data
* Some data may not be available in the model. In this case produce a second excel file that contains the assumptions for the use case...
## 2 minute video
* Summary of the use case / why is this a challenge?
* Who is you tool for?
* Business and societal value
* Demo of the tool (if interaction / processing takes longer â€“ edit the video ðŸ˜Š)
* details about the upload / submission of the videos will be given closer to the time.
