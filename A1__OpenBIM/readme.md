# A1: OpenBIM
Warm up project to get your teeth into OpenBIM standards. This assignment is linked to the following learning objectives.

L03: Design rules to check conformance of an IFC mode
L04: Identify, locate and extract the required information for the proposed use case from an IFC model
L06: Evaluate the suitability of software licensing options for digital tools.

The aim of this assignment is to become familiar with the core concepts of OpenBIM. This is doneÂ  through a deep dive into the IFC file format and associated Open BIM standards. The IFC file format is the industry standard for BIM, but many BIM practioners (and some BIM experts) still don't really understand it.

Previously we have focused on the IFC file and helping you to understand how it is structured, this year we will push this idea further by exploring the file in the awesome OpenBIM tool blender. This allows us the opportunity to pull several exercises together into the same environment.

## Assignment
Install Blender and the BlenderBIM plugin.
Import one of the course example files into Blender and explore the IFC file and its properties.
In the scripting window you can then use IfcOpenShell to further explore the model (we provide examples)
You will identify a simple BIM Use case examples could be gathering:
areas of the building,
quantities of materials,
could you estimate cost? - if so how?
what else can you think of?
Develop a script (based on examples and support from the teachers) to satisfy the identified use case.
Get a github account, (at least one per team), this will make it possible to host your code on the github and make it easier for us to provide you support and also get feedback and help from your peers. Ultimately we are trying to build a strong community or OpenBIM learning at DTU and this is a great way to do it ðŸ˜Š

## Activity Completion
Your group must submit your modified script file for the use case, this should be provided in a â€˜repoâ€™ in the github account linked to your group. The repo will include:

### 01 Python script
* Your main.py file that is a copy of the script we can run in Blender.
* *THIS CAN BE WORK IN PROGRESS* 

### 02 A markdown file that describes: 
* Describe the use case you have chosen
* Who is the use case for?	
* What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise did you use to solve the use case
* What IFC concepts did you use in your script (would you use in your script)
* What disciplinary analysis does it require?	
* What building elements are you interested in?	
* What (use cases) need to be done before you can start your use case?	
* What is the input data for your use case?	
* What other use cases are waiting for your use case to complete?

### 03 A BPMN file
* Describes the use case
* Shows the exchange of information between the stakeholders in the use case
* Helps you to define the scope of your script
* Helps you to see what inputs and outputs your use case has.
