# BIM Use Cases (Taken from the IBIMD Project)

## BIM Use 1: Design Authoring ​
Design Authoring is a process of using BIM authoring software and tools to create and develop an Information Model of the project progressively to support selected BIM Uses before project milestones which includes a database of properties, quantities, means and methods, costs and schedules. The architect, engineer, surveyor, consultant, contractor, sub-consultant and sub-contractor shall use the BIM authoring software and tools to develop their designs and produce views and drawings including but not limited to 3D perspective, layout plan, elevation, section, detail, fabrication and shop drawings. The software and tools are also used to produce schedules (room, door, window, finishes, and panel for distribution board, etc.). The same principle applies to all types of projects and disciplines. ​

## BIM Use 2: Design Reviews ​
Design Reviews is a process for stakeholders to view a model, images and drawings from the models or animated walk-throughs of the project, provide feedback and validate numerous design aspects such as meeting the Appointing Party’s / Client’s requirements and previewing spaces and layouts in digital deliverables. The reviewers shall check layout, sightlines, lighting, security, disabled access and egress, wayfinding, ergonomics, acoustics, textures and colours, etc. The review can be done by using computer software only or with special virtual mock-up facilities, such as immersive lab, etc. Virtual mock-ups can be performed at various levels of detail depending on project needs. ​

BIM authoring software and tools with functions such as real-time high definition rendering (photo realistic), user interactions and simulations can be used to facilitate the effectiveness and efficiency of the design review / presentation process and meetings. Fully rendered still shots, animated BIM renditions, fly through and walk through visualisation can be produced for design review to facilitate the coordination meeting and stakeholder engagement. ​

Design Reviews shall also be used as part of the identified shared review and approval process as documented in this Standards.​

## BIM Use 3: Drawing Generation (Drawing Production)​
Drawing Generation is a process of using BIM to produce 2D drawings, which shall be adopted in both design stage and construction stage. ​

​As far as practicable, all 2D drawings shall be generated from the BIM authoring software and tools directly. Approval shall be sought from the Appointing Party / Client for the exemption of producing any drawings from BIM. ​

A registration list showing the relationship between the Information Models and 2D drawings shall be created to indicate whether each 2D drawing is generated from the BIM or not. Any 2D drawings which are produced from non-BIM authoring software or tools shall be prepared in accordance with the standards for 2D drawings as specified in the contract documents. In case any drawing is not created natively in the BIM authoring software it should be linked to the Information Models.​

## BIM Use 4: Existing Conditions Modelling​
Existing Conditions Modelling is a process of creating a 3D model of the existing site conditions, such as 3D point cloud model, 3D mesh model and 3D individual photo-realistic models. The existing conditions model should be developed by land surveyor from laser scanning, photogrammetry, conventional survey method, record drawings and digital map products available from Lands Department. For historic graded buildings, the author shall include heritage documentation and assessment prepared by the architect and structural engineer. The existing condition models are used for design visualisation and planning, as well as field verification and facility management. They shall be supplemented by photographic records.​

In the planning / design stage, the existing site condition, and existing building condition for alterations and additions (A&A), shall be surveyed by the above-mentioned technologies to produce 3D point cloud and / or mesh model to facilitate project planning and design development. If necessary, 3D individual photo-realistic models or Information Models of existing structure / building can also be generated.​

In the construction stage, 3D digital survey technology such as laser scanning shall be employed to provide verification of the as-built condition for the construction works. It also provides documentation of the environment for future modelling, design coordination and facility management.

## BIM Use 5: Sustainability Evaluation​
Sustainability Evaluation is a process in which a project model is evaluated based on BEAM Plus, LEED, or other sustainable / green building criteria. This process should occur during all stages of the facilities’ life including planning, design, construction, and operation. ​

This comprehensive process requires all disciplines to interact earlier by providing valuable insights. Energy analysis and simulations, calculations, and documentation should be performed within an integrative environment when responsibilities are well defined and clearly shared. ​

Information Models can also be utilised to facilitate various evaluations such as integrated design and construction management, sustainable sites, energy use and water use, air quality, embodied carbon of building structures and material usage of different parts of the building structure.

## BIM Use 6: Cost Estimation​
Cost Estimation / 5D modelling is a process in which BIM can be used for cost estimates throughout the life cycle of a project. ​

### Quantity take-off and cost estimating ​
In the design stage, the Information Models can generate more accurate quantities for project cost budgeting, project cost control and cost evaluation on design options, etc. as far as practicable. In the tender stage, the Information Models can be used for extracting quantities in the preparation of pricing documents [and the Information Models shall form part of tender information to indicate the design intent layout and the material quantities for the tenderers’ information]. ​

### 5D modelling / cash flow forecasting ​
In the construction stage, the Information Models can be used for extracting quantities for project cost control, cost evaluation on the variation of works, cash flow forecast, spending analysis, interim payment, etc. as far as practicable. The 5D Model shall be adopted in the regular project progress meeting to indicate and compare the current cash flow status with the baseline forecast to facilitate project management.

## BIM Use 7: Spatial Coordination (formerly 3D Coordination)​
Spatial Coordination is the whole process of design error avoidance using federated Information Models and a collaborative shared design environment. The goal of the coordination process is to eliminate design errors before construction of the project. The BIM coordination process shall also include but not be limited to the checks for spatial and headroom requirements, working spaces for building operations and maintenance activities, installation and replacement of equipment and machines. Modelling teams are required to deliver coordinated information and must undertake their own check, review, and approve process prior to the sharing of information. ​

The procedure for undertaking the model check includes:​
* To compare Information Models built up from designs of different disciplines; ​
* To ensure models are coordinated with the current shared information; ​
* To ensure models include all reference file names, revision, version, status code and authorisation codes; ​
* To identify spatial clashes, mark-ups, comments and priority for actions; ​
* To report spatial coordination conflicts to the responsible parties and if necessary, the Appointing Party / Client or its representatives for decision making; ​
* To ensure information is spatially coordinated and revise design information upon instruction; ​
* To rebuild / update Information Models; ​
* To identify coordinated models for sharing as suitable for coordination, submission and approval; and ​
* To document changes, revision history and approved copies..

## BIM Use 8: Engineering Analysis ​

Engineering Analysis is a process that uses the Information Model to assist, analyse and optimise different design options to determine the most effective engineering solution to meet design codes and Appointing Party's / Client’s requirements. ​

### Structural Analysis ​
For structural analysis, the analytical modelling software utilises the BIM design authoring model to determine the behaviour of a given structural system including demolition, ground investigation, site formation, foundation and superstructure systems. Based on this analysis, further development and refinement of the structural design takes place to create effective, efficient, and constructible structural systems. The development of this information is the basis for what will be passed onto the digital fabrication and construction system in design stages. ​

### Ventilation Analysis ​
For ventilation analysis, analytical modelling software can utilise the BIM design authoring model and incorporate the model into a site model so as to predict the performance for Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD), Air Ventilation Assessment (AVA), micro-climate analysis, etc. ​

### Lighting Analysis​
For lighting analysis, analytical modelling software can utilise the BIM design authoring model to determine the behaviour of a given lighting system. This can also include artificial (indoor and outdoor) and natural (daylighting and solar shading) lighting. Based on this analysis further development and refinement of the lighting design take place to create effective, efficient, and constructible lighting systems. The application of this analysis tool allows performance simulations that can significantly improve the design and performance of the facility's lighting over its life cycle and comfort requirements. ​

### Energy Analysis / Thermal Analysis ​
For energy analysis in the design stages, one or more building energy simulation programs use a properly adjusted Information Model to conduct energy assessments for the current building design. The core goal of this BIM Use is to inspect building energy standard compatibility and seek opportunities to optimise the proposed design to reduce the structure's operation costs. ​

### Fire Engineering​
Where fire engineering is adopted, the BIM design authoring model can be utilised to assist the evaluation between the Deemed-to-Comply provisions and the performance requirements, assist in identifying additional fire safety provisions to compensate for the deviation or shortfall, facilitate quantitative analysis to assess an alternative solution, etc. ​

### Civil Engineering​
For civil engineering works, the models can be analysed for site formation (cut & fill) hydraulic design of water supply, waste treatment, sewerage and storm water drainage systems. ​

### Other Engineering​
Analysis Other engineering analysis may include thermal, mechanical, acoustic, environmental noise, plumbing, drainage, people movement analysis, risk analysis, etc. The model can be used to predict the performance of a system which should then be compared to actual performance data such as commissioning results.

## BIM Use 9: Facility Energy Analysis ​

Facility Energy Analysis is a process of using a building energy simulation programme with a model to conduct energy assessments of a project design to optimise the design to reduce energy cost hence life cycle costs. By checking the building energy standard compatibility and conducting energy assessment using Building Energy Simulation and Analysis Software, the energy model shall be delivered and the predicted energy uses can be specified. The results of facility energy analysis can facilitate the energy benchmarking.

## BIM Use 10: Building Code Checking and Validation​

Building Code Checking and Validation is a process of reviewing compliance with building codes and regulations that apply to the project through one or more Information Models. Code validation software may be utilised to check the model parameters against project specific codes. ​

Currently BIM is submitted as supplementary information for reference only; the Buildings Department processes approval of plans under the Building Ordinance based on the information contained in the plans. In case of any discrepancy between the plans and BIM submitted, the plans shall prevail. ​

Reference shall also be made to Statutory Submission under Drawing Generation (Drawing Production).

## BIM Use 11: Phase Planning (4D Modelling)​
Phase Planning (4D Modelling) is a process in which an interactive 4D model (3D models with the added dimension of time) is utilised to effectively plan the construction sequence and space requirements on a building site. ​

In the design stage, Phase Planning (4D Modelling) shall include construction sequence simulation for visually demonstrating and communicating project construction sequence based on proposed design and requirements on the project. Construction activities with very high to extreme risk level or other activities as the Appointing Party / Project Manager considered appropriate shall be included. The BIM shall include all major systems and shall contain sufficient data to show planned sequential construction in animation. Any assumptions (e.g.: construction programme, phasing, temporary structures, if any) shall be communicated, commented and agreed by the Appointing Party / Client. A comparison of the planned activities verses the actual activity is required. Meetings to review and forecast of the time activities shall be carried at regular intervals to ​

The 4D simulations can also include the demonstration of the sequence of construction of the prefabricated, MiC* and DfMA* elements / units from fabrication, transportation to installation on site. The swept path analysis from the port (marine transport) or factory (land transport) to the site of the above elements / units is also required.​

## BIM Use 12: Digital Fabrication​
Digital Fabrication is a process for digitalizing the construction details in the Information Model for mass customized components such as metal cladding, acoustic panels, building façade panels, ceiling panels, acoustic barriers, metal structural members, etc. which are of large quantities and variety in dimensions, shapes, geometries, etc. Digital Fabrication shall be adopted for prefabrication process in factories.​

As far as practicable, the Information Models may be able to transfer directly to the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines for fabrication and manufacturing. The Information Models can also be used for prototyping with 3D printers as part of a design intent review process. 

## BIM Use 13: 3D Control and Planning​

3D Control and Planning is a process that utilizes a model to layout project elements such as the position of walls using a total station with survey points preassigned in the model, the process of automating the control of equipment's movement and location such as using Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, to determine if proper excavation depth is reached or assembling components on site.​

3D Control and Planning can be adopted in construction stage to link the Information Models with Grid Systems to increase efficiency and productivity by decreasing time spent surveying in the field. Control points shall be directly generated from the Information Models with the adoption of machinery with GPS capabilities and digital layout equipment together with Information Model transition software.​

## BIM Use 14: 3D Construction Coordination​
3D Construction Coordination is a process of further coordinating the federated Information Models from design stage to construction stage. Designers, consultants, main contractors, sub-contractors and suppliers shall be involved in this coordination. The goal of the coordination process is to eliminate design errors before construction of the project and enhance the efficiency and constructability of the Information Models. Practical system layout arrangement due to site condition, limitation / details of the component purchased from suppliers and coordination between discipline sub-contractors shall be taken into considerations.

## BIM Use 15: Maintenance Scheduling​
Maintenance Scheduling is a process in which the functionality of the building structure (walls, floors, roof etc) and equipment serving the building (mechanical, electrical, plumbing etc) are maintained over the operational life of a facility. A successful maintenance program will improve building performance, reduce repairs, and reduce overall maintenance costs. ​

It shall be adopted in construction stage in collecting and providing maintenance attributes, such as maintenance cost, expected lifetime, mean time between failure, warranty start/end day, maintenance parties, etc., for facility structures, fabrics and equipment in the ABIM as considered appropriate. Record model shall be provided for tracking maintenance history

## BIM Use 16: Space Management and Tracking​
Space Management and Tracking is a process in which BIM is utilised to effectively distribute, manage, and track appropriate spaces and related resources within a facility. The ABIM containing the facility information shall allow the facility management team to analyse the existing use of the space and effectively apply transition scheduling activities / planning management towards any applicable changes. ​

The ABIM can be used to assess, manage and track spaces and associated resources within a project. A BIM can be integrated with spatial tracking software to analyse the existing use of space, apply transition planning for renovations and refurbishment projects.

## BIM Use 17: Sales and Marketing​
Design and Construction Professionals ​
When a project offer includes 3D walkthrough and an accurate budget, the designers and contractors demonstrate engineering know-how and a technological edge. By taking advantage of BIM as a marketing tool, designers and contractors can beat larger competitors with more resources at their disposal.​

## BIM Use 18: Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) ​
Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) is an extent of the swift-developed Building Information Modelling (BIM). It is not just a digitalized building with physical, architectural, functional social and cultural characteristics, but can also with the implementation of new technologies, HIM provides a new way for working in collaboration. ​

The asset data and three-dimensional model can be used for effective management and create more effective methods of maintaining and conserving the heritage buildings. New technologies such as laser scanning, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based photogrammetry are used for the BIM process. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC) tags, quick response (QR) code, augmented reality (AR) are being used for the user-friendly detection of heritage tourism and maintenance workflow at the heritage site. ​

With the 4th dimension, time, introduced into the 3D models, different phases or era of the asset can be modelled to indicate the progress or evolution of changes throughout the asset history, different historical or cultural non-graphical information can be attached to its appropriate phases. Model viewer with sliding historical display can reveal the asset outlook and its corresponding historical information for visualisation, education, maintenance, preservation, guided tour / virtual tour and tourism uses.
