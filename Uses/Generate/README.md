# Generate
Objective: to create or author information about the facility. Synonyms: create, author, model. 
Description: Within the lifecycle of a facility almost every discipline that interacts with the facility will generate information about the facility. This purpose of BIM Uses includes those where BIM is used to create or author information about the facility. It includes prescribing, arranging, and sizing facility elements to various levels of development. Within the design phase, the design team will be the primary generators of information, while in the construction phase, the subcontractors will generate most of the information. Additionally, in the operations phase, that information could be generated by those maintaining the facility when they update or change that facility. Anytime new information is authored, modelled, or created, it is generated.
