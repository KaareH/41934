# Command Line

This is written for windows, but we will update for mac / linux soon.

We like the command line - the firt versions of this code focused OpenBIM course focused on exclusively using the command line.

Now we use other tools, but we still need to able to navigate in the command line.

Fire it up
type cmdline in the windows taskbar

cd - change directort
mkdir - make a new directory

## examples 
### jump to specific location
cd ../
