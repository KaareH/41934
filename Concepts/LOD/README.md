# LOD

LOD (Level of Detail) solves the problem of uncertainty about the level of detail to include in a model. For simplicity this course focuses on DIKON LOD guidelines, although this could be applied to other LOD specifications.

This session looks at the Dikon Guidelines and explores the concept of LOD in BIM.
