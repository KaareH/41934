# LOD (Level of ....)

LOD is tricky as it can mean different things. These can be summarised as LOX....

## Level of Detail
solves the problem of uncertainty about the level of detail to include in a model. For simplicity this course focuses on DIKON LOD guidelines, although this could be applied to other LOD specifications.

Indicates how much detail is included in the model element. It comprises the accuracy of a virtual shape representation when compared to the physical and functional characteristics of the actual object.

This session looks at the Dikon Guidelines and explores the concept of LOD in BIM.

## Level of Information (LoI)​
Indicates the non-graphical content in the BIM model at every stage of its development.

## Level of Development
LOD is the degree to which an element's geometry and attached information must be presented, or the degree of the level of information that project team members can rely on. Includes LOD and LOI.

$LoD+LoI=Level of Development (LOD)$

### LOD 100
Objects represented by symbols or simplified 3D, without indication of real physical geometry.

Modelling:​
* 2D drawing (plan, section or view), used to generate generic model of component detail or annotations;​
* 3D simple or imported from CAD software;​
* Generation of constructive details based on drawings already established in CAD software.​

Parameters:​
* It does not contain additional parameters and definitions of materials;​
* Non-parametric model.​

Quantitative:​
* It only counts the quantity and cost of objects entered in the model by categories and areas.​
  
Analysis:​
* Only the 3D drawing can be used for analysis of clash detection and construction execution plan.
