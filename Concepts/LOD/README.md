# LOD (Level of ....)

LOD is tricky as it can mean different things. These can be summarised as LOX....

## Level of Detail
solves the problem of uncertainty about the level of detail to include in a model. For simplicity this course focuses on DIKON LOD guidelines, although this could be applied to other LOD specifications.

Indicates how much detail is included in the model element. It comprises the accuracy of a virtual shape representation when compared to the physical and functional characteristics of the actual object.

This session looks at the Dikon Guidelines and explores the concept of LOD in BIM.

## Level of Information (LoI)â€‹
Indicates the non-graphical content in the BIM model at every stage of its development.

## Level of Development
LOD is the degree to which an element's geometry and attached information must be presented, or the degree of the level of information that project team members can rely on. Includes LOD and LOI.

$LoD+LoI=Level of Development (LOD)$
