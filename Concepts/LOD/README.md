# LOD (Level of Detail)

LOD (Level of Detail) solves the problem of uncertainty about the level of detail to include in a model. For simplicity this course focuses on DIKON LOD guidelines, although this could be applied to other LOD specifications.

Indicates how much detail is included in the model element. It comprises the accuracy of a virtual shape representation when compared to the physical and functional characteristics of the actual object.

This session looks at the Dikon Guidelines and explores the concept of LOD in BIM.
