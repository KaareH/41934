# Classification

>Classification systems attempt to solve the problem of non standard entity descriptions. They enable different countries and regions to have their own names for objects.

## Challenges
Managing the challenges of classification systems is a key component of the [manager] role in OpenBIM.
* conversion between Classification systems.
* Model Classification completeness checking.
* selecting the correct descrition with certainty.
* choosing which classification system to specify for your project.

Advanced Classification Problems
* Automated Classification. See Kristian Brinks thesis on this [here](

There are many different types of classification in BIM. In this session we will try to map the elements we identify in the Duplex model to 2 different classification systems.

* CCS (Popular in Denmark)
* Uniclass (Popular in UK)
* OnmiClass (Popular in North America)
