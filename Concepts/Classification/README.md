# Classification

Classification systems solve the problem of non standard entity descriptions. They enable different countries and regions to have their own names for objects.

## Challenges
* conversion between Classification systems [manager]
* Model Classification completeness checking  [manager]
* selecting the correct descrition with certainty [modeller]
* choosing which classification system to specify for your project [manager]

There are many different types of classification in BIM. In this session we will try to map the elements we identify in the Duplex model to 2 different classification systems.

[manager]: /41934/Roles/Manager
[modeller]: /41934/Roles/Modeller
