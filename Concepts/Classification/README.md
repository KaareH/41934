# Classification

>Classification systems attempt to solve the problem of non standard entity descriptions. They enable different countries and regions to have their own names for objects.

## Challenges / Issues
Managing the challenges of classification systems is a key component of the [manager] role in OpenBIM.
* Conversion between Classification systems.
* Model Classification completeness checking.
* Selecting the correct descrition with certainty.
* Choosing which classification system to specify for your project.
* knowing if an entity exists in a system.
* Where to put entities that *don't really fit*.

Advanced Classification Problems
* Automated Classification. Use of Machine Learning to support the automated classification of building information models.

There are many different types of classification in BIM. In this session we will try to map the elements we identify in the Duplex model to 2 different classification systems.

* CCS (Popular in Denmark)
* Uniclass (Popular in UK)
* OnmiClass (Popular in North America)
