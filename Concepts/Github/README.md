# Github

>Really this concept should be called Git, Github is just a convenient platform that makes it easier to use apply teh git protocols to version control your projects.

Get a github account, (at least one per team), this will make it possible to host your code on the github and make it easier for us to provide you support and also get feedback and help from your peers. Ultimately we are trying to build a strong community or OpenBIM learning at DTU and this is a great way to do it ðŸ˜Š
