# Building Information Modelling

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a digital process that encompasses creating and managing a building's information throughout its entire lifecycle, enabling multiple stakeholders to collaboratively design, construct and operate a Facility in a virtual space.

[ISO 19650] defines BIM as the "use of a shared digital representation of a built asset to facilitate design, construction and operation processes to form a reliable basis for decisions“. 

## BIM Benefits
BIM enables better communication, coordination, and collaboration among project teams, reducing errors and improving efficiency throughout the entire building lifecycle, from design and construction to operation and maintenance. ​

It allows for better visualization, simulation, and analysis of building performance, helping to optimize design decisions, detect clashes and conflicts, and identify and resolve issues early in the process. Also supports the integration of various disciplines and trades, such as architecture, structural engineering, mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic (MEP) systems, and construction sequencing, resulting in more accurate cost estimation, improved project scheduling, and enhanced sustainability and energy analysis.​

In summary, BIM is a digital approach to building design, construction, and operation that utilizes a collaborative and data-driven model to improve communication, coordination, and efficiency, leading to better project outcomes and more sustainable built assets.


## BIM Challenges

* Silos
* highly differentiated software and tools.
