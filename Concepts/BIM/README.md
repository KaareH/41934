# Building Information Modelling

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a digital process that encompasses creating and managing a building's information throughout its entire lifecycle, enabling multiple stakeholders to collaboratively design, construct and operate a Facility in a virtual space.

The current constant search for solutions to reduce costs, improve productivity and make businesses profitable in the construction industry, in addition to the increasingly present discussion and application of sustainability, made all areas find technology a strong ally in this expansion. For this reason, the BIM methodology has proven to be the most efficient way of working in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry that generates the best benefits.​

The BIM is the process and concept of creating and managing the physical and functional characteristics of the building, using digital representation systems. It is the digital information model that involves not only the 3D geometry of a building but contains data on the characteristics of all the elements that make up a building (for example, beams, walls, windows or electrical sockets), also including their properties and attributes, such as dimensions, materials, suppliers, costs, etc. This digital model serves as a shared repository of information that can be accessed and updated by all stakeholders involved in a construction project, including architects, engineers, contractors, and facility managers.

[ISO 19650] defines BIM as the "use of a shared digital representation of a built asset to facilitate design, construction and operation processes to form a reliable basis for decisions“. 

## BIM Benefits
BIM enables better communication, coordination, and collaboration among project teams, reducing errors and improving efficiency throughout the entire building lifecycle, from design and construction to operation and maintenance. ​

* Visualization and analysis in the same phase of the project;​
* Better constructive solutions;​
* Efficiency in coordination and compatibility;​
* Improvement of the design and construction process;​
* Energy performance analysis;​
* Compliance with legal requirements;​
* Greater precision and reliability in the project;​
* Increased productivity;​
* Collisions and overlaps detection;​
* Decrease in working time;​
* Decrease in costs.​

It allows for better visualization, simulation, and analysis of building performance, helping to optimize design decisions, detect clashes and conflicts, and identify and resolve issues early in the process. Also supports the integration of various disciplines and trades, such as architecture, structural engineering, mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic (MEP) systems, and construction sequencing, resulting in more accurate cost estimation, improved project scheduling, and enhanced sustainability and energy analysis.​

BIM allows for the creation of a virtual model that integrates various design and construction disciplines, such as architecture, structure, and MEP systems. Without BIM, coordination among different stakeholders may be more challenging, as it relies on manual exchange of information through drawings and documents. This can result in clashes, conflicts, and delays during construction, leading to costly rework and project delays.​

BIM enables [clash detection] and automated error checking, helping to identify and resolve issues early in the design and construction phases. Without BIM, errors may go unnoticed until the construction phase, resulting in costly rework and delays. Misinterpretation of design intent or lack of coordination among different disciplines may lead to discrepancies in construction documents, resulting in changes and modifications during construction, further impacting project costs and timeline.​

BIM allows for efficient collaboration among stakeholders in a virtual environment, enabling real-time updates, revisions, and coordination. Without BIM, communication and coordination may be slower, relying on traditional methods such as meetings, emails, and manual markups on drawings, which can result in delays and inefficiencies in decision-making and project progress.​

BIM provides 3D visualization and simulation capabilities, allowing stakeholders to better understand the design intent and make informed decisions. Without BIM, stakeholders may have limited visualization, relying on 2D drawings, which can be harder to understand, leading to misinterpretation, miscommunication, and potential design issues.​

BIM promotes a collaborative environment where stakeholders can work together in a coordinated manner. Without BIM, collaboration may be limited, relying on traditional communication methods, which can hinder effective teamwork, coordination, and information sharing among stakeholders, potentially leading to misunderstandings and delays in the project.

In summary, BIM is a digital approach to building design, construction, and operation that utilizes a collaborative and data-driven model to improve communication, coordination, and efficiency, leading to better project outcomes and more sustainable built assets.

The MacLeamy Curve shows that the cost of making design changes is lowest in the early stages and increases exponentially as the project progresses. Therefore, it is more cost-effective and efficient to make changes and adjustments during the early design phases, when it is still easier and less expensive to implement changes.

For more context please read the amazing post by Daniel Davis on the MacLeamy Curve [(Davis, 2011)].


## BIM Challenges

* Silos
* highly differentiated software and tools.

## BIM Adoption
BIM adoption requires a holistic approach that encompasses people, processes, and technology and involves the integration of digital models and data throughout the entire building project lifecycle. It involves integrated digital models and data throughout the entire building project lifecycle, which implicates collaboration, digital modeling, information integration, lifecycle approach, process efficiency, and standardization. BIM process must include:
Automatic manipulation of analyses;​
* Automatic updates;​
* Simulations;​
* Parametric objects;​
* Integrated database manager;​
* Interoperability.

## Federated Models
A BIM model that combines multiple single-discipline models into one, but they remain linked rather than integrated, meaning that the files of each discipline are separate. The Federated Model keeps the models of different disciplines separate, with links established between them. This can allow for more independence and flexibility in managing individual disciplines' models, with less potential for unintended changes or clashes affecting other disciplines. However, it may require more effort to manage the coordination and synchronization between the linked models, and clashes may need to be resolved manually.

## Integrated Models
A BIM model that combines multiple single-discipline models into one. Unlike the Federated Model, it consolidates all the properties of individual models into a single database. The Integrated Model combines all the properties of individual models into a single database, allowing for a more streamlined and coordinated approach to designing, analyzing, and managing the project. It facilitates interdisciplinary coordination, clash detection, and can result in a more seamless collaboration between different disciplines. However, it may require more effort to establish and maintain the integration, and updates to one discipline's model may impact other disciplines.​

## Integrated of Federated?
The choice between an Integrated Model and a Federated Model depends on the specific project requirements, the team's expertise and workflow, and the available software and tools for coordination and collaboration. Both approaches can be effective, and the suitability of either depends on the project's unique needs and the preferences of the project team.
