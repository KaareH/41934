# Software Licenses

Software Licenses solve the problem of uncertainty about if it is possible to use and if you have the right to view or edit the source code of the software.

Please note that OpenBIM is founded in [Open Software licenses](https://opendefinition.org/)

* There is really good advice on this from Github [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)

For this course we decided on GPL-3.0 because it also has code in it, but if it didn't haVE source code it would probably be sensible to choose [(CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). That is how Penn State choose to license their BIM Use documentation.
