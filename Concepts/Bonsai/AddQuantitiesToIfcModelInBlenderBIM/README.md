# How to add quantities to an IFC model in BlenderBIM
Adding quantities (Quantity Sets) to an IFC model is easy to do in BlenderBIM. Just select all objects you want to calculate quantities for, go to the BlenderBIM tab in the N-menu (open it by clicking **N** or the little arrow) and click on the **"Calculate All Quantities"** button. Now, all physical objects have a Qto_XXBaseQuantities filled out. Remember to save your modified IFC file afterwards!
