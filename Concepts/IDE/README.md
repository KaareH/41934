# IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

IDEs solve the problem of providing a place that understands and can help correct your code, add libraries to it, and if necessary 'build' and or 'run' it. These come in different flavours.

## Gihub Code Editor
If your code is already in github and you would liek to use an online cloud basde version of visual studio code you can press
> jdnjnsdg on your keyboard

## Enhanced Text editor

In the first iterations of the course we used [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/), it works for python and most opther langauages but is limited.

## Full integrated Development Environment
These can be lanuage specific - for instance [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) for Python or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) for Java. Recently in this course we have been using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) which supports multiple languages.

Then we moved to Visual Studio Code.
Now we are thinking that BlenderBIM could be the IDE environment...
