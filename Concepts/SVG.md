# SVG
SVG solves the problem of applying, editing and reading meta data in vector drwaings. It can also be natively opened in a web browser.

[Dwg] files are propritory and binary meaning that they are not easy to edit. SVG offers a future alternative.

Furthermore SVG native drawing software such as [Inkscape] is amazing and a genuine alternative to Illustrator. If further interested check out [GIMP] as an alternative to Photoshop.
