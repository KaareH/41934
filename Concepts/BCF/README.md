# BIM Collaboration Format (BCF)

BCF solves the problem of communicating BIM issues between different softwares.

It is a file format that allows adding text, images and more data to a model, improving team communication. â€‹

For the coordination, it allows for easier and safer communication between the team members.

The BCF is a file format that is open and based on XML, designed to facilitate collaboration between all parties involved in a project. It allows to add comments to the model, simplifies communication, and aids collaboration. It enables stakeholders to raise concerns, resolve issues, and provide answers to questions, making the collaboration process smoother and more efficient.
