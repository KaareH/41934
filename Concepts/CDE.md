# Common Data Environment

CDEs solve the problem of having data in different places and making it harder to coordinate and manage building information.

The CDE is a repository of all the information about a project. This central source of information enhances collaboration and helps to avoid mistakes like duplication.

Cohesive BIM Wiki [link](designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Common_data_environment_CDE) for CDE.


A bit like an [IDE](/Concepts/IDE) but for BIM models.
