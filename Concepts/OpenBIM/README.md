# OpenBIM

OpenBIM solves the problem of closed propritory BIM in the AEC that locks us into expensive software silos and ultimately increases disciplinary siloing. We want a more scientific approach to BIM which requires that we have BIM data in a standard format and can reproduce the same experiments across different BIM models without worrying about which software it was authored in.


OpenBIM is a set of principles that guide a set of standards that solve the problem of interoperability of data in the AEC.
