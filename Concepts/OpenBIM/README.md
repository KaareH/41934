# OpenBIM

OpenBIM solves the problem of closed propritory BIM in the AEC that locks us into expensive software silos and ultimately increases disciplinary siloing. We want a more scientific approach to BIM which requires that we have BIM data in a standard format and can reproduce the same experiments across different BIM models without worrying about which software it was authored in.

Universal approach to collaborative design, implementation, and operation of buildings. It is founded on open standards and workflows, and entails utilizing the most appropriate BIM software solution for each project within each discipline's local context.

OpenBIM is a set of principles that guide a set of standards that solve the problem of interoperability of data in the AEC.
