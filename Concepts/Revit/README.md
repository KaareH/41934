# Revit

Revit is really useful for translating Closed BIM Revit files into [IFC] files.

When doing this we need to be careful about the 'mapping' for the Revit objects and families to IFC entities.

Graduate education in BIM does not include Revit training, for this there are pletny of available resources fro you to try.
