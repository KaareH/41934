# BIM Execution Plan

## Why do we need it?
BIM execution plans (BEPs) solve the problem of stakeholders not knowing what is expected from their building information modelling.

### Overview
* Cohesive BIM Wiki [link](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/BIM_execution_plan_BEP) for BEP.
* https://www.breakwithanarchitect.com/post/iso-196650-in-3-minutes-bim-execution-plan
* The original Penn State [BIM Project Execution Planning Guide 3.0](https://psu.pb.unizin.org/bimprojectexecutionplanning/)

The BIM Execution Plan is a document that defines the BIM strategy and processes for the successful completion of the project. Will detail project deliverables stipulated by the contract and information exchange requirements.â€‹

## How does it work?
They provide clarity on what, when, where, how and to what detail as well as who is responsible to delivering and checking the information.

## Who is it for?
BXPs are then an essential tool of [managers] and coordinators and valuable resource to [modellers] and [analysts].
