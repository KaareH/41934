# BIM Execution Plan

## why do we need it?
BIM execution plans (BXPs) solve the problem of stakeholders not knowing what is expected from their building information modelling.

## how does it work?
They provide clarity on what,when,to what detail and who is responsible to delivering and checking the information.

## who is it for?
BXPs are then an essential tool of [managers] and coordinators and valuable resource to [modellers] and [analysts].
