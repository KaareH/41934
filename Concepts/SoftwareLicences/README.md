# Software Licenses

Software Licenses solve the problem of uncertainty about if it is possible to use and if you have the right to view or edit the source code of the software.

* There is really good advice on this from Github [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)
