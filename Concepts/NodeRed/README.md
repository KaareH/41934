# Node-Red

Node-Red solves the problem of having to code complex API interfaces for your BIM applicaitons. Instead it enables you to connect and manipulate any data that you have access to in a visual programming interface that is similar in feel to Grasshopper or Dynamo.

This enables you to concentrate on developing exciting applicaitons.

Furthermore the flows you create can be saved as small json files that are easy to share with others.
