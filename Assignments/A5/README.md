A5: Project Reflection
In this final assignment you will use the peer feedback to your 2 tutorials to write a brief reflection on:

your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
- What else you still need to learn
- how you might use OpenBIM in the future

1. process of developing the tutorial
- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we haev more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

2. feedback on the tutorial
- did the tool address the use case you identified?
- was the use case well modelled
- was the project clearly scoped

Future
Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
