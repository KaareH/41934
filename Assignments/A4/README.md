# A4: OpenBIM Champion
### Learning Objectives
8. Teach an advanced BIM concept you have learned in the course to your peers and reflect on peer feedback on this.
   
This assignment supports you to develop the skills to transfer knowledge in an organization. It aims to address; how do we ‘learn from BIM’ at an organizational level? You will therefore have to consider how to teach what you have learnt in the process to another group of students. Ideally this would give students a chance to learn a concept thye otherwise would not have time for in the course. Suggested tools include:
* short tutorial videos,
* markdown files,
* carefully commented code and or
* Jupyter notebooks.

The peer lesson will take place in the [final session of the course].

Aim: To learn from the experience of managing an OpenBIM project or develop ontologies to support the collaboration with knowledge from different domains. These activities are done in parallel. 

Furthermore, there would be a chance for them to develop custom content that could be linked to in the course learning environment that, with the student’s permission, could be used in future iterations of the course to support student learning as part of the circular education system.

The tutorial should include
* Identification of the [role learning level] that you are targeting 1,2 or 3. please check the different [roles] to see the levels.
* Address your a specific [focus area] and BIM use.
* If using code, Ideally be written in Python, but can be other approaches in special cases if agreed with the course responsible.
* be tested by your peers
* be reviewed and feedback provided by your peers.
