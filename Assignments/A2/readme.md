# A2: OpenBIM Modeller / Analyst

## A2A: OpenBIM Modelling
Aim: 
### Learning Objectives
12. Evaluate [software licensing](/Concepts/Software_licences/README.md) suitability and implications for the OpenBIM tool you develop or modelling tool you use.
    
This could include information and processes from other digital sources and platforms, i.e. 3D printing / rapid prototyping, as well as drone, mixed reality and laser scanning (Wang Liyuan et al., 2020). The main challenge here is to validate the BIM model and use current tools or tools of their own to fix issues efficiently. The model group would thoroughly check the received IFC file and fix missing or incorrect geometric and non-geometric information. This should be in collaboration with an analysis (A2B) group. Furthermore, they could develop their own models, but the emphasis in this assignment would be on maintaining, reusing and further developing existing models or sub systems (OpenBIM principle 2) for a specific disciplinary use case.


We introduce potential future BIM tools and then in class we investigate their connections and the roles they will play in your future careers. This assignment is linked to the following learning objectives.



In this activity you will be introduced to a [‘metadisciplinary framework’ for BIM (McGinley Krijnen, 2022)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363579368_A_framework_for_meta-disciplinary_building_analysis/stats). 



## Aim

We have gathered the four most exciting potential future (open)BIM technologies in this course however it is uncertain how they fit together and the design and engineering experience that they could provide you in your future careers.

Therefore, the aim of this assignment is in your groups to explore focused parts of this future (open) BIM ecosystem, supported by theory, frameworks and examples provided in the course lectures.
