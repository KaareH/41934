# A2: OpenBIM Modeller
We introduce potential future BIM tools and then in class we investigate their connections and the roles they will play in your future careers. This assignment is linked to the following learning objectives.

* L03: Design rules to check conformance of an IFC mode
* L05: Evaluate an IFC model and provide appropriate feedback / guidance for a specific use case and user.
* L06: Evaluate the suitability of software licensing options for digital tools.

In this activity you will be introduced to a [‘metadisciplinary framework’ for BIM (McGinley Krijnen, 2022)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363579368_A_framework_for_meta-disciplinary_building_analysis/stats). Building on the investigation of BlenderBIM and Speckle in Activity 1, in A2 we will introduce IFC.JS and Linked Data.

As an advanced course in BIM our intention is not to ‘teach’ software but to introduce concepts and tools that you can then develop expertise in and we can help you when you run into challenges.

## Aim

We have gathered the four most exciting potential future (open)BIM technologies in this course however it is uncertain how they fit together and the design and engineering experience that they could provide you in your future careers.

Therefore, the aim of this assignment is in your groups to explore focused parts of this future (open) BIM ecosystem, supported by theory, frameworks and examples provided in the course lectures.

## Activity Completion


### 1) [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) / download as zip the code in [HTML-Build-IFC-Converter](https://github.com/timmcginley/HTML-Build-IFC-Converter)
We are starting from the [HTML-Build-IFC-Converter](https://github.com/timmcginley/HTML-Build-IFC-Converter) repo as it provides a prototype BIM system that yuou can adapt. The aim is that you think about how the use case you indentified in the previous submission could be applied here to guide the receivers of that guidance. Specifically you should consider:
* The example files only really work for a 'tall' repetitive building.
* What information can you get from the IFC for your use case from the previous assignment?
* What guidance might the 'end user' need?
* What analysis can you perform to support this guidance based on the info you have available?

### 2) Get the code to run on your machine
To check see that the date and time of the index file in the output folder ahve changed.

### 3) Make changes to the resulting index.html file
The best way to start might be to try and edit the index.html file directly. This way you can start to think about the guiddnace that you want the page to offer - perhaps you coudl sketch this, if you are not confident to edit the files directly.

### 4) Try and edit the code so that it offers guidance relative to your use case.
This does not need to be a world changing thing, it could jsut be adding text to each of the floors in the index.html file. If you are not sure how to do this, please ask :) Can you parts of the code you wrote from the previous assingment?

### 5) Include a changes.md file in the folder / repo that includes:
* the complete folder to get both the python to run (only including the models and output folders that you are using.
* a changes.md markdown describing in detail the changes you made - you can also add images / screenshots to your md and store these in an img folder as discussed previously.

### 6) Identify a licence for your script and apply this to the github code
This is based on the conversation from last week. There is a link here to the [licence chooser](https://choosealicense.com/)

### 7) be proud of what you ahve acheived, its pretty awesome that you have mangaged to build your own BIM system :)

## Submissions 22
- [Team 1](https://github.com/kfjordt/11034-advanced-bim/tree/main/Assignment%202) - Ported the original code to JS, adding an input function, need to think about how to keep the resulting HTML source clean - but a really, really great start!
