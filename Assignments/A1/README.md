# A1: Learning from OpenBIM (Forensic BIM)
Warm up project to get your teeth into OpenBIM standards. This assignment supports the following [learning objectives].

### Learning Objectives
2. Identify, locate and extract information from an [IFC] model in [OpenBIM] tools
3. Apply appropriate [OpenBIM standards] and guidelines to support open and [FAIR] data, tools and processes.
7. Identify [BIM] challenges by analysing [OpenBIM] data.


**The aim of this assignment is to become familiar with the core concepts of OpenBIM**. This is doneÂ through a deep dive into the IFC file format and associated Open BIM standards. The [IFC data model](/Concepts/IFC) is the industry standard for BIM, but many BIM practioners (and some BIM experts) still don't really understand it.

## Assignment Details

### 1) Make a group 
* 2 people - exceptionally could be 3
### 2) Define a [focus area].
* find a focus area that you are interested in - it could be two that overlap if you cannot decide on one.
### 3) Choose the relevant model form the Stanford / Skylab models
* Download the [Stanford models](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/le/content/167582/Home) or Skylab models (on Learn -> "IFC Models" -> "Stanford models" - *Enrolled Students Only*
* Select the model that best represents your focus area.

### 4) Convert the IFC to an Excel work book using the IFA tool
[IFA Tool](/41934/Concepts/IFCFileAnalyzer)

* Install IFA
* generate the spreadsheet

### 5) Have a look around

* You can use this [tool from Dion Moult](https://blenderbim.org/search-ifc-class.html) to help find the entities you are looks for also you can [search the IFC4 schema here](https://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/)
     
### 6) Add a sheet to the work book you have generated, then use data from the other sheets to provide a dashboard of the building.

What you choose to represent in your dashboard is up to you. but you could consider trying to represent:

* areas of the building,

* quantities of materials,

* could you estimate cost? - if so how?

* what else can you find in the IFC data that you could use in your dashboard?

### 7) Submission

Your group must submit your modified excel including the dashboard sheet as the first sheet in the workbook.

You are not submitting any reports with this, so make sure that your dashboard is easy to understand - how do we know what we are looking at, and what you tried to do?
