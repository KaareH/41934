# Assignments

>As an advanced course in BIM our intention is not to ‘teach’ software but to introduce concepts and tools that you can then develop expertise in and we can help you when you run into challenges. Ultimately the aim of the course is that you will develop new OpenBIM tools and techniques and be able to teach your future colleagues how to learn from OpenBIM too.

* A1	Learning from OpenBIM 
* A2	OpenBIM Modeler / Analysis
* A3	OpenBIM Manager / Ontologist
* A4	OpenBIM Champion
* A5  Reflection

A2 and A3 have 2 options, so participants will help to evaluate and provide peer feedback on each other’s work. 

Participants will get an introductory lecture (video) to both options to support their choice (Adamu & Thorpe, 2016). In this way, the modelling groups will receive guidance from the analysis groups and provide feedback on that guidance back to them. This feedback should also include how it supported them to make decisions and ultimately if it was clear enough to help them to know how to change their model.


## A4: OpenBIM Champion
### Learning Objectives
8. Teach an advanced BIM concept you have learned in the course to your peers and reflect on peer feedback on this.
   
The final assignment focuses on the ability to transfer knowledge in an organization. It aims to address; how do we ‘learn from BIM’ at an organizational level? This is a new component for autumn 2023. For autumn 2023, participants will therefore have to consider how to teach what they have learnt in the process to another group of students. Ideally this would support those that choose Analysis in the 2nd assignment to learn about modelling, or for the ontologists to learn about management. Suggested tools include, short tutorial videos, markdown files, carefully commented code and Jupyter notebooks. Furthermore, there would be a chance for them to develop custom content that could be linked to in the course learning environment that, with the student’s permission, could be used in future iterations of the course to support student learning.
