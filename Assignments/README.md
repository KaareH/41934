# Assignments

activity options the students can choose (based on Figure 2)
#	Learning Activity
* A1	Learning from BIM 
* A2	OpenBIM Modeler / Analysis
* A3	OpenBIM Manager / Ontologist
* A4	OpenBIM Champion

A2 and A3 have 2 options, so participants will help to evaluate and provide peer feedback on each other’s work. 

Participants will get an introductory lecture (video) to both options to support their choice (Adamu & Thorpe, 2016). In this way, the modelling groups will receive guidance from the analysis groups and provide feedback on that guidance back to them. This feedback should also include how it supported them to make decisions and ultimately if it was clear enough to help them to know how to change their model.
## A1: Learning from BIM (Forensic BIM)
### Learning Objectives
2. Identify, locate and extract information from an IFC model in OpenBIM tools
3. Apply appropriate OpenBIM standards and guidelines to support open and FAIR data, tools and processes.
6. Create, fork, branch and collaborate on the development of an OpenBIM tool in Python with peers in a code repository.
7. Identify BIM challenges by analysing OpenBIM data.
   
This assignment Focus on IFC analysis of real (previous) student building design projects from an [advanced building design course](https://github.com/timmcginley/41936) that runs in the previous semester. The Identify what the projects analysed, how did they test this? What was the domain focus of the investigation? Was it structural, energy and indoor, daylight, acoustic, LCA/LCC or something else? They should then be introduced to BPMN and use it to document the use case and explore the role of experts in OpenBIM. Following this, the students should review OpenBIM tools made in the previous year of the OpenBIM course and identify which tools could be used or adapted to solve the problem identified in the design project in the previous part. Finally, they could check the information validity of the models against the use case requirements they identified. 

~~## A2A: OpenBIM Modelling
This could include information and processes from other digital sources and platforms, i.e. 3D printing / rapid prototyping, as well as drone, mixed reality and laser scanning (Wang Liyuan et al., 2020). The main challenge here is to validate the BIM model and use current tools or tools of their own to fix issues efficiently. The model group would thoroughly check the received IFC file and fix missing or incorrect geometric and non-geometric information. This should be in collaboration with an analysis (A2B) group. Furthermore, they could develop their own models, but the emphasis in this assignment would be on maintaining, reusing and further developing existing models or sub systems (OpenBIM principle 2) for a specific disciplinary use case.~~

## A2: Analyse
4. Provide professional disciplinary guidance based on OpenBIM analysis.
9. Identify and model a BIM use case based on the BIM challenges identified from analysis of an OpenBIM project in [BPMN](/Concepts/BPMN/README.md).
10. Identify an appropriate [development methodology](Concepts/Development_methodology/README.md) for an OpenBIM tool or model to different use cases.
11. Apply and improve programming skills in Python to develop an OpenBIM tool or modelling skills in OpenBIM using your engineering domain expertise.
12. Evaluate software licensing suitability and implications for the OpenBIM tool you develop or modelling tool you use.
   
This task would focus on analysing the models using scripts as in the previous years using BlenderBIM as an IDE (integrated development environment) incorporating a console, 3d view, IFC data model hierarchy, and IFC property views in one place. Additionally, this assignment would provide the opportunity for the student to develop their own OpenBIM tools in Python.

## A3A: Manage
Learning Objectives
1. Create and manage a BIM Execution Plan based on the OpenBIM standard [ISO 19650](/Concepts/ISO19650/README.md)
7. Identify and model a BIM use case based on the BIM challenges identified from analysis of an OpenBIM project in BPMN.
   
This task focuses on ISO 19650. The intention for autumn 2022 was to integrate real examples of 19650 into the course with practical examples, for instance by prototyping a total process using Speckle that complied to ISO 19650. However, time constraints in planning the course meant that this was ultimately replaced with traditional lectures from external parties. These provided informative content to the students but on their own were not enough for them to see the alignment to the other activities. A future BIM course should be focused on thinking in and gaining experience using ISO 19650 rather than just ‘teaching’ it. The experience of the autumn 2022 course enabled a proposal to map the development methodology (Figure 3) to ISO 19650 (Figure 4).

## A3B: Ontology
### Learning Objectives
5. Apply domain specific linked data ontologies.
11. Apply and improve programming skills in Python to develop an OpenBIM tool or modelling skills in OpenBIM using your engineering domain expertise.
   
The focus of this assignment is to support the Ontologist role. This should cover both Open Linked building data and traditional classification systems.
## A4: OpenBIM Champion
### Learning Objectives
8. Teach an advanced BIM concept you have learned in the course to your peers and reflect on peer feedback on this.
   
The final assignment focuses on the ability to transfer knowledge in an organization. It aims to address; how do we ‘learn from BIM’ at an organizational level? This is a new component for autumn 2023. For autumn 2023, participants will therefore have to consider how to teach what they have learnt in the process to another group of students. Ideally this would support those that choose Analysis in the 2nd assignment to learn about modelling, or for the ontologists to learn about management. Suggested tools include, short tutorial videos, markdown files, carefully commented code and Jupyter notebooks. Furthermore, there would be a chance for them to develop custom content that could be linked to in the course learning environment that, with the student’s permission, could be used in future iterations of the course to support student learning.
