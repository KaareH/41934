# Assignments

>As an advanced course in BIM our intention is not to ‘teach’ software but to introduce concepts and tools that you can then develop expertise in and we can help you when you run into challenges. Ultimately the aim of the course is that you will develop new OpenBIM tools and techniques and be able to teach your future colleagues how to learn from OpenBIM too.

* [A1	Learning from OpenBIM](A1/README.md)
* [A2	OpenBIM Modeler / Analysis](A2/README.md)
* [A3	OpenBIM Manager / Ontologist](A3/README.md)
* [A4	OpenBIM Champion](A4/README.md)
* [A5  Reflection](A5/README.md)

A2 and A3 have 2 options, so participants will help to evaluate and provide peer feedback on each other’s work. 

Participants will get an introductory lecture (video) to both options to support their choice (Adamu & Thorpe, 2016). In this way, the modelling groups will receive guidance from the analysis groups and provide feedback on that guidance back to them. This feedback should also include how it supported them to make decisions and ultimately if it was clear enough to help them to know how to change their model.
