# A1: Forensic BIM
| | Forensic BIM Assignment  |
| --- | ----- |
| **Aim**|  Identify and fact check project claims in [Advanced Building Design]  |
| **Tools:** |  [Blender] / [Bonsai] / [Python] / [IfcOpenShell]  |
| **Case:** |  Select the claim you want to fact check in your group's [focus] area |
| **Groups:** |  2 - 3 people group for a specific [focus] area|
| **Practice:** | In class activity in week [1], [2] and [3] |

Exercises: Learn Blender / Bonsai and IfcOpenShell
Tools: Kaare's awesome Bimscore tool
Case: Validate claims made in Advanced Building Design Reports.

**The aim of this assignment is to become familiar with the core concepts of OpenBIM**. This is doneÂ through a deep dive into the IFC file format and associated Open BIM standards. The [IFC data model](/Concepts/IFC) is the industry standard for BIM, but many BIM practioners (and some BIM experts) still don't really understand it.

## Task
Apply simple scripts to validate claims made in previous iteraitons of the [Advanced Building Design] course. In your [focus] groups you will check specfic claims made in their project reports. aS example these could (depending on your focus area) include: 
* Project GFA,
* Spaces required in the [project brief](/41936/Project/Breif)
* Energy Frame
* Facade transparency ...
* What other things can you think of?

You will analyse the models using scripts as in the previous years using Blender / Bonsai as an IDE (integrated development environment) incorporating a console, 3d view, IFC data model hierarchy, and IFC property views in one place.

## Steps

Week 1
* Install Blender / Bonsai

Week 2
* Make a group with the same focus area
* Select a manager group
* Review Project documentation for that focus area.
* Select a claim to check.


### 5) Have a look around
* You can use this [tool from Dion Moult](https://blenderbim.org/search-ifc-class.html) to help find the entities you are looks for also you can [search the IFC4 schema here](https://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/)

### 7) submit your report / update your github diary.

This assignment supports the following [learning objectives].

### Learning Objectives
2. Identify, locate and extract information from an [IFC] model in [OpenBIM] tools
3. Apply appropriate [OpenBIM standards] and guidelines to support open and [FAIR] data, tools and processes.
7. Identify [BIM] challenges by analysing [OpenBIM] data.

## Submission 2024
Enrolled students submit on DTU Learn [here](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folders_list.d2l?ou=215344&isprv=0)

### 3) Choose the relevant model from the Stanford / Skylab models
* Download the [Stanford models](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/le/content/167582/Home) or Skylab models (on Learn -> "IFC Models" -> "Stanford models" - *Enrolled Students Only*
* Select the model that best represents your focus area.

### 4) Convert the IFC to an Excel work book using the IFA tool
[IFA Tool](/Concepts/IFCFileAnalyzer)

* Install IFA
* generate the spreadsheet

What you choose to represent in your dashboard is up to you, but it should match the focus area and use case you have chosen. Think about what information would be necessary to solve your use case.

You could consider trying to represent:

* areas of the building,

* quantities of materials,

* could you estimate cost? - if so how?

* what else can you find in the IFC data that you could use in your dashboard?

### 6.a) Add a sentence about your use case at the top of your dashboard. Concider how the information you're showing supports your use case.

### 7) Submission

Your group must submit your modified excel including the dashboard sheet as the first sheet in the workbook.

You are not submitting any reports with this, so make sure that your dashboard is easy to understand - how do we know what we are looking at, and what you tried to do?
