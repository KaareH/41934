# 41934 Advanced BIM

Advanced BIM enables you to get the information you need to analyse and design building systems in your disciplinary specialism. This requires interoperability and standardisation; therefore this course focuses on Open BIM data and standards. Excitingly there is an emerging emerging ecosystem of OpenBIM tools supported by IfcOpenShell for instance that are starting to provide an OpenBIM alternative to contemporary inoperable closed BIM tools and data. We believe that University education has a responsibility to support the transition in the AEC to OpenBIM data and standards.  To achieve this, the Advanced BIM course at DTU therefore supports five emerging OpenBIM roles including: modelling, analysis tool development, management/coordination and ontology development. The aim of the course is to support you to become an OpenBIM champion (guru) in your chosen role(s) in the course supported by your disciplinary expertise i.e. LCA or structural analysis for instance. At the end of the course your group is required to develop a tutorial to teach one of these concepts to a group of peers to demonstrate your expertise in the area. The course has three main principles.
1) Open, FAIR and Standardised
2) Reusable and Maintainable
3) Agnostic and Guiding

The course is divided into 5 modules, each module builds on the previous one to guide you through identifying your use case and the data you need to analyse to create your tool or workflow. The course focuses on the IFC schema to provide you with a robust, future proof and interoperable understanding of BIM.

## OpenBIM [Roles](/Roles)
The OpenBIM roles are an extension of the original three BIM roles, (modeller, analyst, manager / coordinator).

* R1: OpenBIM [Modeller](/Roles/Modeller)
* R2: OpenBIM [Analyst](/Roles/Analyst)
* R3: OpenBIM [Manager](/Roles/Manager)
* R4: OpenBIM [Ontologist](/Roles/Ontologist)
* R5: OpenBIM [Guru](/Roles/Guru)

## Learning Objectives
The course learning objectives are organised into three main priniciples.
### Principle 1. Open, FAIR and Standardised
~~1. Develop a BIM Execution Plan for a specific use case based on the OpenBIM standard ISO 19650.~~
~~2. Identify, locate and extract information for a specific use case from an IFC model.~~
~~3. Apply appropriate OpenBIM standards and guidelines to support open and FAIR data, tools and processes in a specific use case.~~
~~4. Provide professional disciplinary guidance based on OpenBIM analysis for a specific use case.~~

### Principle 2. Reusable and Maintainable
~~5. Develop expertise in two of four OpenBIM roles (Modelling, Analysis tool development, management / coordination or Ontologist)~~
~~6. Create, Fork, branch and collaborate with peers in a code repository.~~
~~7. Identify BIM challenges by analysing OpenBIM data (i.e. IFC files and project reports from previous advanced building design projects or models produced by peers in this course).~~
~~8. Teach an advanced BIM concept you have learnt in the course to your peers.~~
### Principle 3. Agnostic and Guiding
~~9. Identify and model a BIM use case based on the BIM challenges identified from analysis of an OpenBIM project in BPMN.~~
~~10. Identify an appropriate development methodology for an OpenBIM tool or model to satisfy the identified use case.~~
~~11. Apply and improve programming skills in Python to develop an OpenBIM tool or modelling skills in OpenBIM using your engineering domain expertise to address a specific use case.~~
~~12. Evaluate software licensing suitability and implications for the OpenBIM tool you develop or modelling tool you use.~~

## Focus on problems you care about
This course has been designed so that the emphasis is on learning FROM BIM rather than learning HOWTO BIM [(McGinley & Krijnen, 2021)](https://itc.scix.net/paper/w78-2021-paper-070). Also, from the perspective of BIM us in the early design stages of tall buildings, [Omrany, et. al, (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580523001942#s0020) provide an excellent overview on the literature for 7 use cases. However it is not possible to support every possible use case, therefore the course focuses on the following:

* LCA
* Structure
* Cost
* Indoor & Energy
* Acoustic
* Daylight

## Code examples
The super exciting thing about this course is that it tries to move from the old way of running linear courses, where students repeat the same standard exercise each year and try and change it.

## Course information booklets

The information booklets are in the process of being converted to markdown. In the mean

##  BIM Awesome

We are at an exciting point in BIM at the moment, it is a real moment where the future is being defined in front of our eyes. We are trying to bring together some of these developments in a list repo called [bim awesome](https://dtu-byg.github.io/BIM-awesome/).
