# 41934 Advanced BIM

The primary aim of the course is to teach you how to gather, analyze and communicate building information from [IFC](Concepts/IFC) models for real architectural engineering challenges. Finally you will teach your peers a concept you have learnt in the course. To create OpenBIM data, processes and tools that we can learn from, the course has the following principles:

1. Open, FAIR and Standardised
2. Reusable and Maintainable
3. Agnostic and Guiding

This requires interoperability and standardisation; therefore this course focuses on Open BIM data and standards. Excitingly there is an emerging emerging ecosystem of OpenBIM tools supported by [IfcOpenShell](Concepts/IfcOpenShell) and others that provide an OpenBIM alternative to contemporary inoperable closed BIM tools and data. We believe that University education has a responsibility to support the transition in the AEC to OpenBIM data and standards.  To achieve this, the Advanced BIM course at DTU supports five emerging OpenBIM [Roles].

## Course Features
* 5 Emerging [roles](Roles/README.md) for you to experience
* 5 Stimulating [Assignments](Assignments/README.md) that support you to become an OpenBIM Champion / Guru
* Learning objectives aligned to the needs of the whole AEC and society (not just the software industry).
* Focused on Architectural Engineering Students, but also good for Civil Engineering and some Architecture.

## OpenBIM [Roles]

* R1: OpenBIM [Modeller](Roles/Modeller)
* R2: OpenBIM [Analyst](Roles/Analyst)
* R3: OpenBIM [Manager](Roles/Manager)
* R4: OpenBIM [Ontologist](Roles/Ontologist)
* R5: OpenBIM [Guru](Roles/Guru)

The secondary aim of the course is to support you to become an OpenBIM champion (guru) in your chosen role(s) in the course supported by your disciplinary expertise i.e. LCA or structural analysis for instance. At the end of the course your group is required to develop a tutorial to teach one of these concepts to a group of peers to demonstrate your expertise in the area. The course is divided into 5 [Assignments], each module builds on the previous one to guide you through identifying your use case and the data you need to analyse to create your tool or workflow. The course focuses on the IFC schema to provide you with a robust, future proof and interoperable understanding of BIM. Check the course [Schedule].

## Architectural Engineering Focus Areas
This course has been designed so that the emphasis is on learning FROM BIM rather than learning HOWTO BIM [(McGinley & Krijnen, 2021)](https://itc.scix.net/paper/w78-2021-paper-070). Also, from the perspective of BIM us in the early design stages of tall buildings, [Omrany, et. al, (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580523001942#s0020) provide an excellent overview on the literature for 7 use cases. However it is not possible to support every possible use case, therefore the course focuses on the following:

1. [LCA] / Materials / Sustainability Assessment
2. [Structure]
3. [Indoor] & Energy / Acoustic / Daylight
4. [Construction] / Cost / Buildability / Permits

## Code examples
The super exciting thing about this course is that it tries to move from the old way of running linear courses, where students repeat the same standard exercise each year and try and change it.

## Course information booklets

The information booklets are in the process of being converted to markdown. In the mean

##  BIM Awesome

We are at an exciting point in BIM at the moment, it is a real moment where the future is being defined in front of our eyes. We are trying to bring together some of these developments in a list repo called [bim awesome].
